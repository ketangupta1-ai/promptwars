The attribute and products understanding must be related to query itself as the attribute of ight bulb will be different from the attribute of the solar panel or TV.
You must be telling the query and then all the attribute in the json so that there is better understanding for debug purpose
The application must be able to generate json array for multiple queries.
The application should be to understand other languages.
for multiple queries the json format would look like (refrence json file).
